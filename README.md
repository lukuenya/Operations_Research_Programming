## Solving some OR problems with python using mostly Google OR-Tools.

The fastest way to get OR-Tools is to install the Python binary version. If you already have Python (version 3.6+ on Linux, Mac OS or Windows), and the Python package manager PIP, you can install OR-Tools as follows:
`python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools`

### Main steps in solving Linear Programming problms : 
        1. Import the required libraries.
        2. Declare the solver.
        3. Create the variables.
        4. Define the constraints.
        5. Define the objective function.
        6. Invoke the solver and display the results.
